# Nicegui Authentication with hCaptcha
This piece of code extends the official nicegui authentication sample that can be found [here](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/blob/main/examples/authentication/main.py)

To run this app, you need to get your site and secret key from hcaptcha.com. Add them to the .env file and you're ready to start the app using `python3 app.py`
